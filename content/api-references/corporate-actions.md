# Corporate Actions

This API endpoint offers the ability to retrieve historical corporate action announcements. There are four primary types of corporate action announcements which can be defined as follows.

- Dividend: a sum of money paid regularly, typically quarterly, by a company to its shareholders out of its profits or reserves
- Merger: the combination of a parent and child company into one larger entity
- Spinoff: the creation of an independent company through the sale or distribution of new shares of an existing business or division of a parent company
- Split: a division of existing shares of a company's stock into multiple new shares resulting in a change in price and shareholder quantity
  - Reverse Split: a subtype of a standard stock split in which a company is merging multiple stocks into one

### Constraints

In order to preserve the integrity of Alpacaâ€™s database performance for all users, the ca_type, since, and until fields are required. Please note that it is acceptable to pass in all five corporate action types in the form a list of strings. Additionally, the limit on the length of the date range interval is 90 day intervals per API call, however, you may make multiple calls of 90 day blocks should the need arise to capture corporate action announcements over a longer time frame. Should an invalid date range be passed that breaks these limitations, the following error message will occur.

```
{
    "code": 40010001,
    "message": "invalid param: since & until cannot be more than 90 days apart"
}
```
